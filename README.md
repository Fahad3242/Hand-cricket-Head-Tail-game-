# Hand-cricket-Head-Tail-game-
1.	PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: 
I have created a hand cricket game using C++ programming language. It is a fun game in which there is a match between AI and a user in which certain numbers between 1 to 6 can be used. If the numbers of both AI and the user match then the one batting gets out else the batsman gets runs added up. 
2.	FEATURES OF OUR PROGRAM: 
There are many features in our program as we take the name of the user as an input as a protected data member. We have taken member functions to make the numbers between 1 to 6 and it produces an error when the number exceeds the limit. Each player will have two wickets and two overs and either if both wickets fell or the overs finish then a innings will end.
