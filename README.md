# Hand-cricket-Head-Tail-game-
I have created a hand cricket game using C++ programming language. It is a fun game in which there is a match between AI and a user in which certain numbers between 1 to 6 can be used. If the numbers of both AI and the user match then the one batting gets out else the batsman gets runs added up.
